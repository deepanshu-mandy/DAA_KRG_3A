# DAA_KRG_3A

This repository contains ten core experiments based on major algorithmic design techniques. It covers searching (Linear and Binary Search), sorting (Merge, Quick, Insertion, Selection, and Bubble Sort), and optimization problems like the Fractional and 0/1 Knapsack. Advanced topics include graph algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal’s, and Prim’s), Backtracking with the N-Queens problem, and the Travelling Salesman Problem using Dynamic Programming and Branch and Bound approaches.
